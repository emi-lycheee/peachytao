## Tarnishing

While our earrings are tarnish-resistant, there may be times where you find your earrings look duller than before.
If this is the case, follow these steps to bring your jewelry back to it's original appearance!

1.  Prepare a bowl of Windex window cleaner
2.  Soak the jewelry for a few minutes
3.  Scrub gently with a toothbrush
4.  Rinse with warm water
5.  Pat dry with a dry paper towel
